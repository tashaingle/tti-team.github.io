        <li>Provide a quote for our services</li>

      <h3>4. Legal Bases for Processing (UK GDPR)</h3>
      <p>We rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to respond to your enquiry, provide quotes, follow up on potential
          services and manage our relationship with you as a property owner or business contact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a contract (or steps before entering into one):</strong> where we need to process
          your information to provide you with a quote or to manage services you have asked us to deliver.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal obligation:</strong> to keep records required by law, e.g. accounting and tax records.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we ever rely on <strong>consent</strong> (for example, for optional marketing emails), we will ask you clearly,
        and you can withdraw that consent at any time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in fade-in-delay-3">
      <h2>5. Who We Share Your Information With</h2>
      <p>We may share your personal information with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> who help us run our website and handle enquiries, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>FormSubmit (for processing form submissions and emailing them to us)</li>
            <li>Email and website hosting providers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Professional advisers</strong> such as accountants or legal advisers, where necessary.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Law enforcement or regulators</strong> where we are legally required to do so, or where it is necessary
          to protect our rights.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We only share the minimum information needed and require service providers to keep your information secure and
        to use it only for providing their services to us.
      </p>

      <h3>6. International Transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Some of our service providers (for example, email or form processing services) may store or process data outside
        the UK/EEA. Where this happens, we aim to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard
        contractual clauses or other recognised data protection mechanisms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
      <h2>7. How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your personal information only for as long as it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this
        policy, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To respond to your enquiry or quote request</li>
        <li>To consider and provide our services</li>
        <li>To comply with legal, accounting or reporting obligations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many cases, this means we may keep enquiry and quote records for up to <strong>6 years</strong> after our last
        contact with you, unless a longer period is required by law or needed for potential legal claims.
      </p>
      <p>We will delete or anonymise information when it is no longer needed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in fade-in-delay-2">
      <h2>8. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using reputable service providers for website hosting, forms and email</li>
        <li>Limiting access to personal data to those who need it for legitimate business purposes</li>
        <li>Using password protection and other reasonable security practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we do our best to protect your
        personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

    <section class="fade-in fade-in-delay-3">
