    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Bee &amp; Bee Property Management was founded by three partners – <strong>Talha, Tasha and Irene</strong>.
      We started Bee &amp; Bee because we saw how much work goes into running a B&amp;B or short-stay property
      well, and how easy it is for owners to feel stretched between guests, cleaning, maintenance and messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is simple: to take care of the day-to-day tasks, so you can enjoy the benefits of hosting
      without the constant juggling.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="fade-in fade-in-delay-1">
    <h2>Why We Started Bee &amp; Bee</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve seen first-hand how much difference good organisation, clear communication and reliable cleaning
      can make to both owners and guests. Bee &amp; Bee was created to bring all of that together under one roof:
      a small, approachable team that B&amp;B owners can trust with their properties and their guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      We care about the details – from spotless rooms and fresh linens to accurate information for guests and
      quick responses when something needs attention.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Work With Owners</h2>
    <p>
      When you work with Bee &amp; Bee, you’re not just handing your keys to a faceless company.
      You’ll know who you’re dealing with, how to reach us, and what we’re doing for your property.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with a friendly chat to understand your B&amp;B, your goals and how involved you’d like to be.
      From there, we set up a clear plan for cleaning, bookings, guest communication and maintenance support,
      depending on the level of service you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      You stay in control of key decisions, while we handle the practical side of keeping your property
      guest-ready and running smoothly.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Believe</h2>
    <p>
      We believe every guest deserves a clean, comfortable and welcoming stay – and every owner deserves
      a management team they can trust. For us, that means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Presenting each property at its best for every arrival.</li>
      <li>Spotting issues early and communicating clearly with owners.</li>
      <li>Being friendly, professional and reliable in everything we do.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="fade-in fade-in-delay-3">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to provide reliable, friendly and professional B&amp;B management so owners
      can enjoy peace of mind and higher guest satisfaction, without having to handle the daily admin.
      We want Bee &amp; Bee to feel like an extra pair of hands you can genuinely depend on.
